6. Add the file to the staging area:
    ```
    git add index.html
    ```
7. Commit the changes:
    ```
    git commit -m "Initial commit with index.html"
    ```
8. Push the changes to the remote repository:
    ```
    git push -u origin master
    ```

Now your local directory is linked to the GitHub repository, and your changes are committed and pushed.
